# vaccine_effectiveness_screening_method

This project aims to share my understanding and exploration of the screening / case-population method to quickly assess the COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness with available data, in order to inform strategic decisions by the Chief Medical Officer.

The code uses a data.table approach because the original datasets were voluminous. It will hopefully be helpful to others. 

The output is a website created with [workflowr][], that is not yet published. 

If you download the repo, you'll be able to visualise the website by clicking on the [index.html](index.html) in the docs folder. The plots produced are available in _the output > png4ppt_ folder .


Structure and content

- analysis : .Rmd files that will produce the website

- code : .R files 

- data : original data files

- docs : html files of the website

- images : external images

- output : contains subfolders with output produced


Please feel free to comment and give me some feedback.
